# Agentic-AI-Book-Summarizer-with-RAG-Modelling

Agentic-AI-Book-Summarizer-with-RAG-Modelling is an intelligent system designed to generate high-quality book summaries using Agentic AI workflows and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The project automates the end-to-end summarization process by breaking large book PDFs or text documents into smaller chunks, preprocessing them, and storing embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval. Instead of generating summaries purely from the model’s memory, the system retrieves the most relevant content from the book using semantic search and then generates accurate summaries grounded in the source material.

The system follows an agent-based pipeline where different agents perform specific tasks such as chunking, chapter-level summarization, combining summaries into a book-level summary, and producing multiple output formats like short summaries, detailed summaries, and key bullet highlights. RAG improves factual correctness and reduces hallucinations by ensuring that summaries are based on retrieved book content. This project is highly useful for students, researchers, and professionals who want fast and reliable insights from long books, helping save time while maintaining content accuracy and structure.
